    <p>Showunmi Ebunoluwa, a student of Covenant University. He loves learning about different aspects of programming <br>and machine language, even from a young age. Then seeing the world around him becoming increasingly dependent on this,he decided he would learn it.</p>
        <p> He took this love and used it to start learning the very basics of coding and web development. <br>He is currently involved in a training bootcamp for fullstack webdevelopment, where he will gain more knowledge in programming languages like JAVA,SQL and lots more.</p>
        <p>He is a hardworking young man, ready to give his full devotion to any tasks and assignments assigned to him.<br> He is still in the learning process and hence has little experience for now, but he's ready to put in all the effort into becoming a world recognizable web developer and programmer.</p>
